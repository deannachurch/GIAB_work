Attempt to create a bed file of single nucleotide sites for which there was no evidence for the
reference allele in GRCh37 and were flipped to create a common, supported allele in GRCh38.

Jupyter notebooks here:
https://github.com/deannachurch/GIAB_work

Data in a shared Google folder

Files:
GRCh37_GRCh38_flipped_sites.bed: bed file in GRCh37 coordinates created from a
spreadsheet sent by Valerie (where InAGP == 'Y').

GRCh38_GRCh37_flipped_sites.bed: bed file in GRCh38 coordinates created by using
NCBI remap to translate the GRCh37 coordinates to GRCh38 coordinates.

remap_data/*: this directory contains the raw outputs from the NCBI remap process.

Workflow:
CreateGRCh37_GRCh38_flippedsites_bed.ipynb: read spreadsheet and create bedfile
in GRCh37 coordinates

Remapped using default parameters (GRCh37->GRCh38)

CheckRemappedSites.ipynb: checked the ref allele in GRCh38 matched the 'alt' allele
in GRCh37, then flipped ref/alt in 'name' field of bed.
A handful of sites failed. This seemed to be a combination of sequences changing
orientation between GRCh37 and GRCh38, or possibly some 1-off errors. A couple of sites
appeared to fail, but it was only the secondary alignment that failed.
